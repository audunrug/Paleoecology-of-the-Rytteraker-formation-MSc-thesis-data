# MSc thesis data: _Quantitative paleoecology and gradient analysis of the Rytteråker Formation, Lower Silurian, Oslo region_ (2022)
This is the repository for the supplementary data and R scripts used in the MSc thesis _Quantitative paleoecology and gradient analysis of the Rytteråker Formation, Lower Silurian, Oslo region_.

If something is missing or unclear about the data or scripts (which can be understandable, since some of it is in Norwegian, and the naming and labelling is not always too thorough), please contact me at audunrug@uio.no or arugstad@gmail.com, and I will do my best to help or supply futher material.
